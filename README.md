## 🎯 Abstract
The **Advanced Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is a GUI-based Python project that demonstrates and compares the working of multiple sorting algorithms in real-time.  
Developed using **Tkinter** for the graphical interface and **Matplotlib** for data visualization, this project aims to provide students with a clear and interactive way to understand the core concepts of **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**.

Users can:
- Select a sorting algorithm
- Control sorting speed and data size
- Watch the algorithm sort data step-by-step with dynamic animations

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ GUI built with **Tkinter**  
✅ Real-time bar graph animations using **Matplotlib**  
✅ 5 Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
✅ Adjustable sorting speed (delay control)  
✅ Adjustable array size (number of elements)  
✅ “Stop” option for instant control

## 🧩 Objectives
1. To visualize the working of multiple sorting algorithms dynamically.  
2. To understand algorithm performance through step-by-step execution.  
3. To compare time complexities and efficiency visually.  
4. To build an educational and interactive DAA learning tool using Python.
